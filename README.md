This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# IMPORTANT!

### I think about this test, I can success in less than 1 day but now I used 2 days because I'm see this test is about Sports Website. I think if we create Sports Website, We will have more sports to presentation in our app, so I have created a reusable component of dynamic UI, contents and image to be more easy and flexibility reusable to others Sports in our production website.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
